    This is my solution for the Base Apparel coming soon page design challenge on Frontend Mentor. The objective was to recreate the design as accurately as possible with email validation. Take a look at the live site!

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- **Bonus:** Dark mode toggle

### What I learned

Building this project has provided me with valuable learning experiences. One of the challenges I encountered was implementing email validation using JavaScript, which involved learning about regular expressions and how to validate user input.

Additionally, I improved my layout skills by working with responsive images and using CSS Grid.

Overall, this project has helped me to build on my existing knowledge and gain new insights.

### Useful resources

- [RegexMagic](https://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html) - This article by <b>Jan Goyvaerts</b> provides an in-depth explanation of how to use regular expressions to validate email addresses. The article not only explains how to write regular expressions for email validation but also covers the common mistakes made while writing regular expressions for email validation.

It provides clear and concise examples of regular expressions for email validation and also explains the logic behind each regular expression.
